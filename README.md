Gravity
=======

Gravity is a heavily WIP OpenGL rendering engine written in C++17 and the Concepts Lite TS. It is mostly a playground to try out new features and libraries, and is therefore not really usable yet.

Dependencies
------------
* SDL2
* glbinding 2.0

Requirements
------------
* gcc >= 6.2
* An OpenGL 4.5 implementation, plus support for Sparse Textures
